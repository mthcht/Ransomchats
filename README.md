# Ransomchats
Here you'll find ransomware negotiations normalised as JSON files. 
Ransomware negotiations are usually not shared widely, limiting the understanding of the process. 
This project aims at changing that, in a respectful manner for the victims of cyberattacks: chats are anonymized as long as the victim hasn't been publicly disclosed, either by the attackers or in the media.
